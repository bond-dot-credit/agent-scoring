# Bond.Credit — Scoring Agent

## Overview
This branch contains **all code, documentation, and resources related to the AI Agent Scoring Engine** for Bond.Credit.  
It serves as the dedicated workspace for developing, testing, and refining the metric definitions, scoring algorithms, and data pipelines that determine creditworthiness for agents.

All scoring-related work — including sub-branches, commits, and pull requests — will originate from here.

## Scope of Work
The `agent-scoring` branch is the home for:

1. **Metric Definition**  
   - Identifying, categorizing, and documenting the performance, risk, liquidity, and other metrics used in scoring.
   - Storing metric definitions in structured formats (JSON/YAML) with descriptions, formulas, data sources, and dependencies.

2. **Formula Implementation**  
   - Translating defined metric formulas into executable code.
   - Ensuring calculations match the reference documentation.

3. **Data Acquisition & Processing**  
   - Integrating on-chain/off-chain data sources.
   - Cleaning, standardizing, and storing retrieved data in `/data`.

4. **Scoring Algorithm Development**  
   - Implementing the overall scoring formula that combines metrics into a unified agent score.
   - Testing, validating, and refining scoring logic.

5. **Standardization & Validation**  
   - Ensuring metric definitions and code are consistent in units, lookback periods, and naming conventions.
   - Creating validation scripts and automated checks.

## Workflow
**Main Development Branch:** `scoring-agent`
- **Feature Branches:** Create from `scoring-agent` (e.g., `feat/add-success-rate-metric`).
- **Commits:** Use conventional commit messages:


**Pull Requests:**
- Target `agent-scoring`
- Link to related GitHub Issue(s)
- Include a summary of changes and relevant formulas
